        <h2>Sweatshops in Bangladesh<h2>
          <article>
            <p>There are more than 4,800 factories and 3.5 million people employed in the Bangladeshi garment industry, producing cheap clothes under appalling working conditions for major UK and international brands. Women account for 85% of the textile work force and are particularly vulnerable to discrimination and abuse. The garment industry accounts for 80% of Bangladesh’s export revenue and is the fourth largest exporter of garments in the world. In December 2010 a new national minimum wage came into force, the first wage increase for 4 years. Previously, the lowest paid garment workers earnt a meagre £15 a month (1,662 taka) but they will now be able to earn £25 a month (3,000 taka), an increase of 80%.  However this is still short of a living wage, calculated to be £45 a month (5,000 taka)</p>

        <h2>Are there any successes?<h2>
          <article>
            <p>After a hard hitting campaign led by the NGWF together with other trade unions a new minimum wage for garment workers was introduced in December 2010. This represented an increase of 80% for the lowest paid garment workers and an average increase across all employment grades of 60%. However, this is still far below the living wage and the NGWF continues to campaign for fair pay that covers the basic needs of workers and their families</p>

        <h2>How you can help?</h2>
          <article>
            <p>One way to help foreign workers is to make conscious buying decisions and to encourage retailers to provide conscious options. ANother important thing to do is shop LESS! A lot of NGOs are doing an amazing job either to imrove working conditions in textile factories - <a href="http://www.waronwant.org/sweatshops-bangladesh"><strong>WAR ON WANT</strong></a>- or to provide tools to garment companies to become more sustainable - <a href="http://www.made-by.org/"><strong>MADE BY</strong></a>.
